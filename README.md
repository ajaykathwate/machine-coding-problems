# Machine Coding Problems

## Overview
A curated collection of **machine coding problems** commonly asked in interviews for beginner and intermediate developers. Each problem is **self-contained** with a detailed description, user flow, examples, and hints (to be added individually in each problem folder).  

This repository is ideal for:  
- **Interview preparation** (UI and console-based exercises)  
- Practicing **React / JavaScript** coding skills  
- Referencing real-world UI patterns and problem-solving exercises  

All problems are organized in **individual folders** with a flat structure, and folder names include a **difficulty tag** (easy/medium) for clarity.
